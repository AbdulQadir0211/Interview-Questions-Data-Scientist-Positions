### Data Science & ML - General Topics

1. ### What is the basic difference between AI, Machine Learning(ML) & Deep Learning(DL)? ⭐
   `Ans:` Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field that encompasses many different techniques and technologies, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). <br />
   - **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It is a broad field that includes many different approaches and techniques, such as rule-based systems, and expert systems. <br />
   - **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subfield of AI that is focused on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable machines to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. <br />
   - **Deep Learning (DL)** is a type of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain's neural networks. It uses multiple layers of artificial neural networks to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. DL algorithms can be used for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making.
   
2. ### Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? ⭐
   `Ans:` The main difference between them is the type and amount of input provided to the algorithms.
   - **Supervised learning** is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, i.e., the model is provided with input-output pairs, and the goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. This mapping can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Examples of supervised learning include regression, classification and prediction tasks. <br />
   - **Unsupervised learning**, on the other hand, is a type of machine learning where the model is not provided with labeled data. Instead, the algorithm is given a dataset without any output labels, and the goal is to find patterns or structure within the data. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection tasks.

3. ### Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? ⭐
   `Ans:` There are several techniques for handling missing data in a dataset, some of the most common include: <br />
   - **Mean/Median Imputation:** This method replaces the missing value with the mean or median of the non-missing values in the same column. (Numerical)
   - **Random Sample Imputation:** This method replaces the missing value with a random sample from the non-missing values in the same column. (Numerical)
   - **Most Frequent Imputation** Most Frequent is another statistical strategy to impute missing values which work with categorical features (strings or numerical representations) by replacing missing data with the most frequent values within each column. (Numerical/Categorical)
   - **Zero or Constant Imputation** By this method, the missing values are replaced by zero/constant values.(Numerical)
   - **Regression Imputation:** By this method, the missing values are predicted using Regression techniques such as KNN Imputation, and Logistic Regression for Categorical missing values.(Numerical/Categorical)
   -  **Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE):** This type of imputation works by filling in the missing data multiple times. Multiple Imputations (MIs) are much better than a single imputation as it measures the uncertainty of the missing values in a better way.

4. ### How do you select the appropriate evaluation metric for a given problem, and what are the trade-offs between different metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score? ⭐
   `Ans:` Selecting the appropriate evaluation metric for a given problem depends on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the model. Here are some common evaluation metrics and the situations in which they are typically used:

	- **Accuracy:** This metric measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. It is commonly used when the classes are well balanced and the goal is to have a high overall performance of the model.
    
	- **Precision:** This metric measures the proportion of true positive predictions to all positive predictions made by the model. It is commonly used when the goal is to minimize false positives. (Ex- Financial Transactions/ Spam Mail)
    
	- **Recall:** This metric measures the proportion of true positive predictions to all actual positive cases in the dataset. It is commonly used when the goal is to minimize false negatives. (Ex-Medical diseases/Stock Market breakdown)
    
	- **F1-Score:** This metric is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances the trade-off between precision and recall and is commonly used when the goal is to have a balance between both.
    
	- **ROC-AUC:** This metric measures the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and is commonly used when the classes are imbalanced and the goal is to have a high overall performance of the model.

5. ### What is the beta value implies in the F-beta score? What is the optimum beta value? ⭐⭐
   `Ans:` The F-beta score is a variant of the F1-score, where the beta value controls the trade-off between precision and recall. The F1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall and is calculated as `(2 * (precision * recall)) / (precision + recall).`
- A beta value of 1 is equivalent to the F1 score, which means it gives equal weight to precision and recall. 
- A beta value less than 1 gives more weight to precision, which means it will increase the importance of precision over recall. 
- A beta value greater than 1 gives more weight to recall, which means it will increase the importance of recall over precision.

6. ### What are the advantages & disadvantages of Linear Regression?⭐
   `Ans:`
- Advantages:
	- Linear regression is a simple and interpretable algorithm that is easy to understand and implement.
	- It is a well-established technique that has been widely used for many years and is a good benchmark for other more complex algorithms.
	- Linear regression can handle large datasets with many input features and it's relatively fast and efficient to train.
	- It's easy to identify and measure the relationship between input features and target variables by looking at the coefficients.

- Disadvantages:
	- Linear regression assumes that the relationship between the input features and the target variable is linear, which may not always be the case in real-world problems.
	- It can't capture non-linear relationships between variables.
	- Linear regression is sensitive to outliers, as a single outlier can greatly impact the line.
	- Linear regression does not account for errors in the observations.
	- Linear regression can be affected by multicollinearity, which occurs when input features are highly correlated with each other.

7. ### How do you handle categorical variables in a dataset?⭐
   `Ans:`Handling categorical variables in a dataset is an important step in the preprocessing of data before applying machine learning models. Here are some common techniques for handling categorical variables:
	- **One-Hot Encoding:** This method creates a new binary column for each unique category in a categorical variable. Each row is then encoded with a 1 or 0 in the corresponding column, depending on the category. *This method is useful when there is no ordinal relationship between categories.*
	- **Ordinal Encoding:** This method assigns an integer value to each category in a categorical variable. This method is useful when there is an ordinal relationship between categories.
	 - **Binary Encoding:** This method assigns a binary code to each category. *This method is useful when the number of categories is high and one-hot encoding creates too many columns.*
	- **Count Encoding:** This method replaces each category with the number of times it appears in the dataset.
	- **Target Encoding:** This method replaces each category with the mean of the target variable for that category.
	- **Frequency Encoding:** This method replaces each category with the frequency of the category in the dataset.
    It's important to note that some of the techniques, like One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding, and Binary Encoding, have the potential to introduce a new feature, which could affect the model performance. *Additionally, target encoding and count encoding could introduce a leakage from the target variable, which could lead to overfitting.*
  
8. ### What is the curse of dimensionality and how does it affect machine learning?⭐
   `Ans:`The curse of dimensionality refers to the problem of increasing complexity and computational cost in high-dimensional spaces. In machine learning, the curse of dimensionality arises when the number of features in a dataset is large relative to the number of observations. This can cause problems for several reasons:
	 - **Sparsity:** With a high number of features, most observations will have many missing or zero values for many of the features. This can make it difficult for models to learn from the data.
	 - **Overfitting:** With a high number of features, models are more likely to fit the noise in the data rather than the underlying patterns. This can lead to poor performance on new, unseen data.
	- **Computational cost:** High-dimensional spaces require more memory and computational power to store and process the data. This can make it difficult to train models and make predictions in real-world applications.
9. ### What are the approaches to mitigate Dimensionality reduction?⭐
   `Ans:`These are some mechanisms to deal with Dimensionality reduction,
   - Techniques like **principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)** can be used to reduce the number of features by combining or selecting a subset of the original features.
	- **Regularization:** Techniques like L1 or L2 regularization can help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model's objective function that discourages the model from fitting to noise in the data.
	 - **Sampling:** With high-dimensional data, it is often infeasible to use all the data. In such cases, random sampling could be used to reduce the size of the data to work with.
	- **Ensemble methods:** Ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting machines can be used to reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance in high-dimensional data.

10. ### Can you explain the bias-variance tradeoff?⭐
   `Ans:`The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the trade-off between how well a model fits the training data (bias) and how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data (variance). <br/>
- Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be incredibly complex, with a much simpler model. High-bias models are typically considered to be "oversimplified" and will have a high error on the training set.
- On the other hand, variance refers to the error introduced by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance models are typically considered to be "overcomplicated" or "overfit" and will have a high error on the test set.

### Data Science & ML - General Topics

1. ### What is the basic difference between AI, Machine Learning(ML) & Deep Learning(DL)? ⭐
   `Ans:` Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field that encompasses many different techniques and technologies, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). <br />
   - **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It is a broad field that includes many different approaches and techniques, such as rule-based systems, and expert systems. <br />
   - **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subfield of AI that is focused on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable machines to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. <br />
   - **Deep Learning (DL)** is a type of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain's neural networks. It uses multiple layers of artificial neural networks to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. DL algorithms can be used for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making.
   
1. ### Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? ⭐
   `Ans:` The main difference between them is the type and amount of input provided to the algorithms.
   - **Supervised learning** is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, i.e., the model is provided with input-output pairs, and the goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. This mapping can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Examples of supervised learning include regression, classification and prediction tasks. <br />
   - **Unsupervised learning**, on the other hand, is a type of machine learning where the model is not provided with labeled data. Instead, the algorithm is given a dataset without any output labels, and the goal is to find patterns or structure within the data. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection tasks.
